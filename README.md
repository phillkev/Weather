# Unit 12 | Assignment - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

##  Assignment
I misunderstood the scope of this assignment so I spent a good portion of my first two days writing this assignment so the webpages would work within flask

So I have two copies of the webpages.  The HTML files in the template directory are older and they do not have all the formating cleanup I later performed on the HTML pages in the root Weather directory.  The app.py does work as do the HTML pages within the templates directory.  I also needed to use url_for convert the pictures to URLs so flask would display them properly.  This function required the directory static.

The next step of development in this app.py was to create a template file to replace cloudiness, humidity, max_temp and wind_speed.  But I realized I was coding in the wrong direction for the assignment and I needed to make my HTML work with github acting as my webserver instead of flask.
